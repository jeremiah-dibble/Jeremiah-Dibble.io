					<h2><a href="https://github.com/jeremiah-dibble/Youtube_Comment_Spam_Id">YouTube Comments <br /> Scam Detection</a></h2>
				</header>
				<p style="text-align: center;">
					With the development of cheaper and more available LLMs, scams originating from bots in YouTube
					comments have become more common and difficult to easily moderate. Luckily, LLMs can also be the
					solution. To solve this problem, I created this API for collecting YouTube comments and using OpenAI GPT-Turbo to classify them
					into scam/spam comments or not. There is also an HTML front end that will allow you to paste a
					YouTube video link and get back a list of the users who are likely leaving spam/scam comments and
					the comments associated with each spam user. 
			
					<br />
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR_Dz1I7tAI" target="_blank">Here is an example from this video, feel free to check if YouTubeâ€™s moderation is as good as mine and see if they have removed the comments yet.</a>

					<p>
						Deciding on the correct architecture to use is often very time consuming and often
						a difficult balance between using enough parameters to obtain optimal performance
						and not using too many such that overfitting occurs and computational power
						is wasted. We have designed a framework to find the optimal architecture for
						an application. Our Dynamic Neural Architecture Search uses a Reinforcement
						Learning Controller to optimally adjust the network architecture during training.

					<p>
						Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to learn the relationship between two groups.
						Then the learned patterns can be used to predict interactions between a new member of either
						group and the other group members. Here we use SVD to learn the relationship between viewers
						movie ratings and the movies themselves. This allows us to predict how a view will feel about
						a movie based on previous responses.

					</header>
					<!-- <a href="Num-LM.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/Num-Cat-Loss.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
					<p>
						We tried implementing a variety of models to predict fire type, starting with a simple random
						forest and decision tree
						model; followed by adaboost and neural networks. The initial simple models were able to classify
						with 55%. The neural network also performed poorly and we de-
						termined it was not an ideal model given the limited number of input variables and the lack of
						complexity.
						Finally, we decided a decision tree with gradient boosting would be ideal for sorting
						categorical data with
						fairly limited number of variables. To implement this model we used Light GBM because it trains
						quickly
						and it we knew we would re-run the model many times in the tuning process.

					<!-- <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
					<p>This paper proposes that a rational investor would set her reference point based on her
						expectation of
						the growth or future value of the asset, rather than the purchase price. When selling,
						traders will receive an additional utility based on the difference between the trader reference
						point
						and current price of the stock, which is the primary non-rational behavior in this model.
						Realization
						utility is supported by Frydman (2012) and I propose this realization utility could me more
						accurately
						modeled as an internal reaction to the belief that the investor accurately set price targets,
						so investors would still value paper gains.</p>
