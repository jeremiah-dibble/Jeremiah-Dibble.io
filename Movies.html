									<h1>Predicting Movie <br /> Ratings (SVD)</h1>
									<h3>Summary</h3>
									<p>
										Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to learn the relationship between two groups. 
										Then the learned patterns can be used to predict interactions between a new member of either 
										group and the other group members. Here we use SVD to learn the relationship between viewers 
										movie ratings and the movies themselves. This allows us to predict how a view will feel about
										a movie based on previous responses.

								<h2>1 &emsp; Basic Visualizations</h2>
								<p>
									In the basic visualization of all ratings of the MovieLens Dataset we noticed that the distribution is
									positively skewed, with more movies having a rating greater than 3, than movies with ratings less than
									3. Furthermore, the most popular rating was a 4/5 compared to a more normal distribution where we
									would expect the most common rating to be a 3/5. The positive skew suggests that most movies are
									generally enjoyed, which may be indicative of the tendency of viewers to watch movies that tend to align
									with interest or genre preference.

									</header>
								<p>In the basic visualization of all the ratings of the 10 most popular movies we noticed that the most 
									to the ratings are positive which was expected, but we also see that there are a handful of the most 
									popular movies that are not rated well. We also need to keep in mind this is likely caused by some 
									of the most popular movies being watched based on the popularity factor instead of aligning with the 
									specific views interest as directly.

								<h2>2 &emsp; Matrix Factorization Visualizations</h2>
								<p>We implemented and created visuals for three different methods.</p>
								<h3>2.1 &ensp; Matrix Factorization Methods</h3>
								<h4>2.1.1 &ensp; Using Barebones SVD </h4>
								<p>
									First we implementedthe barebones svd with k=20 and a range of regularizations to determine 
									which had the lowest validation error. We found the optimal regularization to be 0.1. 
									This produced a mean squared error in predicting Y of 1.22, which we would discover makes 
									it the worst of the bunch. The homework 5 code factorized the matrix by randomly filling U 
									and Y based on a given k. Then U and Y are updated using stochastic gradient decent and with 
									the sum of Frobenius norms used for regularization. The regularization will keep the overall 
									weights in the matrix lower to reduce over-fitting. This model only used SGD on U and Y  and 
									included the normalization in the error calculations.
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="images/movie_ratings/miniproject2_5_U.png" />
									<p><b>Figure 5: Latent Factors of U projection of HW5 SGD Model</p></b>
									<img src="images/movie_ratings/miniproject2_5_V.png" />
									<p><b>Figure 6: Latent Factors of V projection of HW5 SGD Model</p></b>
								</header>
								
								<h4>2.1.2 &ensp; Using the Surprise Package (off the self matrix factorization) With Bias </h4>
								<p>
									Next we used the Surprise Package to conduct the matrix factorization without a bias term. 
									The Surprise package uses a more complex version of SGD with an included row and column 
									bias term. These bias terms compensate for the individuality of particular people or movies, 
									for example if someone tends to rate every movie higher on average that will be compensated 
									from in the bias term. This model performed much better on the test set than the homework 5 
									implementation which indicates that the bias terms helped create a more accurate model. 
									The test mean squared error was .871.
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="images/movie_ratings/miniproject2_sur_SVD_U.png" />
									<p><b>Figure 7: Latent Factors of U projection of Surprise with Bias SGD Model</p></b>
									<img src="images/movie_ratings/miniproject2_sur_SVD_V.png" />
									<p><b>Figure 8: Latent Factors of V projection of Surprise with Bias SGD Model</p></b>
								</header>

								<h4>2.1.3 &ensp; Using the Surprise Package with Non-negative Matrix Factorization </h4>
								<p>
									Lastly we used the Surprise Package again but this time with non-negative matrix factorization 
									(NMF). As the name implies this model only produces positive factor values, which requires 
									positive initialization and a more complex method of SGD. Keeping all the factor values positive 
									could be seen as a prudent move given we are modeling rankings of movies, which cannot be negative, 
									but this model failed to out perform the basic Surprise Package with bias. The NMF may also have 
									under-performed because it is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Lastly, we chose not to use 
									bias on the NMF model because adding a bias term make the model highly prone to over-fitting. 
									This model ranked in the middle of the of the pack on the test set, with a mean squared error of .921.
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="images/movie_ratings/miniproject2_sur_NMF_U.png" />
									<p><b>Figure 9: Latent Factors of U projection of Surprise with NMF Model</p></b>
									<img src="images/movie_ratings/miniproject2_sur_NMF_V.png" />
									<p><b>Figure 10: Latent Factors of V projection of Surprise with NMF Model</p></b>
								</header>

								<h4>2.1.4 &ensp; Conclusion and Best Model </h4>
								<p>
									Based on the mean squared errors on the test set we can determine the relative quality of the 
									three models we implemented. As already discussed, the Surprise Package with bias outperformed 
									all of the other models (.871); followed by the NMF model (.921) and the HW5 code in last place 
									(1.22). From the mean squared errors we can see that most significant change was moving to the 
									Surprise Package, which accounted for the vast majority of the reduction in error from first to 
									last place. The NMF model performed roughly 5\% worse than the bias model, which is seemingly 
									small but the Netflix competition was only for a 10\% increase. Thus we can conclude that the 
									Surprise model with bias is meaningfully better than the other models.
								</p>
								<h4>2.2.1 &ensp; Matrix Factorization Visualization </h4>
								<p>
									Here, we compare the 1st two principal components of the latent factors in the V projection. 
									We observe that along the 1st principal component, the movies tend to be positioned relatively 
									close to each other, with movies such as "Blood for Dracula" being on the far left and movies 
									such as "Dirty Dancing" being near the right-middle. Along the 2nd principal component, we see 
									that the same phenomenon is observed, with movies such as "Dirty Dancing" residing in the lower 
									half and movies such as "Father of the Bride" residing the upper half. However, there are a 
									non-negligible number of outliers which are occasionally different between models. We further 
									observe a rough similarity in the plots between the unbiased SGD and biased SVD models, which 
									makes sense given that the models produce similar latent factors given they both perform ordinary 
									matrix factorization algorithms. However, the NMF model tended to produce much different estimates 
									with comparatively much lower variance along the 1st principal component, likely due to its latent 
									factors being forced non-negative.

								<h2>3 &emsp; Methods</h2>
								<h3>3.1 &ensp;The Problem</h3>
								<header class="major">
								<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;\begin{align*}&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;p^*&space;&=&space;\min_{\theta\in\Theta}&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\mathcal{L}(Y_{\text{val}},&space;\theta(X_{\text{val}}))&space;\\&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&\&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\text{s.t.}&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;&space;\lvert\theta\rvert&space;\leq&space;M&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;\end{align*}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image? \begin{align*} p^* &= \min_{\theta\in\Theta} \ \ \ \mathcal{L}(Y_{\text{val}}, \theta(X_{\text{val}})) \\ &\ \ \ \ \ \ \text{s.t.} \ \ \ \ \lvert\theta\rvert \leq M \end{align*}" />

								</header>
								<p>
								where Yval and θ(Xval)) are the validation labels and predictions, and θ are the learnable parameters
								characterizing the network in the space of all sets of learnable parameters Θ. M is some hard
								constraint on the number of parameters and L is our loss function. However, this primitive formulation
								is relatively limiting as one cannot know how to set M appropriately. Thus, we can rewrite this
								optimization problem as the following to loosen this constraint by adding a Lagrangian term:
								</p>
								<header class="major">
								<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{align}&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;d^*&space;&=&space;&space;\min_{\theta\in\Theta}&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\mathcal{L}(Y_{\text{val}},&space;\theta(X_\text{val}))&space;&plus;&space;\lambda&space;\lvert\theta\rvert&space;&space;&space;&space;\end{align}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{align} d^* &= \min_{\theta\in\Theta} \ \ \ \mathcal{L}(Y_{\text{val}}, \theta(X_\text{val})) + \lambda \lvert\theta\rvert \end{align}" />
								</header>
								<p>
									With this formulation, we now see that we have two objectives: the primary goal should be to
									reduce the test loss, while the secondary goal is to minimize the number of parameters of the model.
									Here, negative of the objective will serve as the reward for our RL Controller. The RL Controller
									uses validation data to adjust the size of the network to avoid training the network architecture to over
									fit the test data. The RL Controller will then try to minimize this reward during training by acting
									on the network, a procedure detailed in the next section. Lastly, the amount of additional training
									between network size adjustments must be sufficiently large to ensure the network has been trained
									with the new elements
								</p>

								<h3>3.2 &ensp;Resizing a Neural Network Efficiently</h3>

								<p>In this work we set Θ to be the parameter space of all networks comprised solely of fully-connected
									layers. When considering how one can resize a network of this type, there are four basic operations
									available:
									
									<p>1. &ensp;Add a unit to hidden layer l.</p>
									<p>2. &ensp;Remove a unit from hidden layer l.</p>
									<p>3. &ensp;Add a hidden layer between layers l and l + 1.</p>
									<p>4. &ensp;Remove hidden layer l.</p>
									<p>When acting on the network in these ways, we simultaneously desire that the output of the network
									changes as little as possible. To add a unit/hidden layer, this is a relatively simple task. Adding a
									unit to a hidden layer is essentially just adding a row to one weight matrix, and a column to the
									next weight matrix (as well as adding a bias term). If all of these entries are 0, then the output of
									the network will not change, hence this is desirable for our use case. The back propagation during
									training will then adjust this newly added row and column to act nontrivially on the latent input.
									Likewise, adding a hidden layer to the network is just adding in a weight matrix. If we make this
									weight matrix an identity matrix, then again, the output of the network will remain unchanged.
									
								</p>
								<p>What is much less trivial is the removal of a unit or hidden layer. Removing a hidden unit means
									that we must remove a row from a weight matrix, and a column from the next weight matrix. Here,
									Wi will represent the i-th row of the first weight matrix, and V
									i will represent the i-th column of the
									weight matrix, while bi will denote the i-th entry of the bias vector acting in between W and V. To
									perturb the network as little as possible, we use the following rule to determine which row/column is
									removed:
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;\begin{align*}&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;r&space;&=&space;\underset{i}{\text{argmin}}&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\lVert&space;W_i&space;\rVert_2^2&space;&plus;&space;\lVert&space;V^i&space;\rVert_2^2&space;&plus;&space;b_i^2&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;\end{align*}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image? \begin{align*} r &= \underset{i}{\text{argmin}} \ \ \ \lVert W_i \rVert_2^2 + \lVert V^i \rVert_2^2 + b_i^2 \end{align*}" />
								</header>

								<p>In other words, we want to take the row/column/bias term which has the smallest magnitude, as
									intuitively this should have the smallest affect on the latent output. Empirically we determined that
									this was the most effective method for minimizing the output between the old output of the network
									and the new ‘reduced’ network output of the methods we tried.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, the problem of removing a hidden layer is relatively simple. Suppose we want to remove
									the Wi weight matrix. If normally in the forward computation, we compute
								</p>
								<p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{align*}&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;W_{i&plus;1}\sigma(W_i\sigma(W_{i-1}z))&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;\end{align*}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{align*} W_{i+1}\sigma(W_i\sigma(W_{i-1}z)) \end{align*}" />
								</header>
								<p>where σ is a ReLU nonlinearity, then we can instead absorb Wi
									into Wi−1 by
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{align*}&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;W_{i-1}'=W_i&space;W_{i-1}&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;\end{align*}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{align*} W_{i-1}'=W_i W_{i-1} \end{align*}" />
								</header>	
								<p>so that the new, ‘approximate’ computation would be:
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;&space;&space;&space;\begin{align*}&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;W_{i&plus;1}\sigma(W_{i-1}'z)&space;&=&space;W_{i&plus;1}\sigma(W_iW_{i-1}z)&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;&space;\end{align*}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image? \begin{align*} W_{i+1}\sigma(W_{i-1}'z) &= W_{i+1}\sigma(W_iW_{i-1}z) \end{align*}" />
	
								</header>
								
								<p>Doing it this way will minimize the distortion created by the absence of the nonlinearity, and
									empirically we showed that this was the most effective method of removing a hidden layer from the
									network while perturbing the output as little as possible.
								</p>
								<h3>3.3 &ensp;The Algorithm</h3>
								<h4>3.3.1 &ensp;Pesudo Code</h4>
								<p>The pseudocode for DNAS is given below:
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<img src="images/sudo_code.jpg" />
								</header>
								<h4>3.3.2 &ensp;Typical training</h4>
								<p>Until, line 5 of the pesudocode the algorithm is essentially standard back-propagation. In lines
								5 through 9 contain the novel portion of this algorithm, which is architecture adjustment and RL
								Controller training. In the simple case of a fully connected network, the model will train with standard
								backpropagation and periodically calculate the current evaluation loss and run the RL Controller. The
								RL Controller uses the historical train loss, evaluation loss, backpropagation gradient, and network
								size to determine if it should shrink, grow, or not modify the architecture. Another empirical finding
								of ours was that in general, it is optimal to let the gradient magnitudes to converge somewhat before
								deciding how to change the network.
								</p>
								<h2>4 &emsp;Experiments and Findings
								</h2>
								<p>
									To test DNAS, we wanted to test the robustness of the controller on a variety of different datasets
									and initial conditions. We present the results for restricting our networks to 1 hidden layer, as we
									unfortunately could not get a model with arbitrary number of hidden layers to learn in a stable fashion.
								</p>
								<p>
									To start, we initialized our networks from 3 configurations for our hidden layer: 16, 64, and 256
									units. From here, we then ran our algorithm to see if these models would roughly converge to the
									same ‘optimal’ architecture. The results are presented in the figure below for the QMNIST, KMNIST,
									and FashionMNIST datasets, each with 3 seeds to ensure that the algorithm was not ‘getting lucky’.

								<header class="major"><b>Figure 1: KMNIST Training</b></header>

								<h3>4.1 &ensp;Empirical Findings
								</h2>
								<p>
									In these three graphs, we see that these models all generally go approach the same architecture,
									indicating that DNAS is working well. As an intuitive verification that our model is working, we
									also note that there seems to be a correlation between the complexity of the data and the size of the
									optimal network. For in the MNIST case, which is the ‘simplest’ dataset consisting of handwritten
									digits, the optimal hidden size was approximately 225 hidden units. However for KMNIST and
									FashionMNIST, the dataset of more ‘complex’ handwritten symbols and clothing items, respectively,
									we see that a larger architecture is desirable, as these datasets converge closer to 275 units.
								</p>
								<p>
									We found that the strongest signal to the model for deciding how to adjust the model was the
									average gradient magnitude for parameter. The graphs above show that the gradient allows the model
									to know how close the model is to optimal, and above a certain number of parameters, the gradient
									cannot get any lower. Thus, the model will naturally go to the smallest network architecture it can
									find while still having a minimal gradient magnitude. We also saw that using losses/accuracy figures
									are generally noisier and harder for the model to interpret
								</p>

								
								<h2>5 &emsp;Discussion
								</h2>
								<p>
									In this work, we have presented a novel framework for dynamically adjusting the size of a network
									during training to optimize for performance and the number of parameters. We have shown the
									algorithms effectiveness on a variety of test cases, and hope to expand this work in the future by
									introducing more potential architectures for a model, as well as making the RL Controller more
									advanced. Ultimately, our goal is that this framework could serve as a wrapper for an arbitrary model
									trained on an arbitrary dataset, and would quietly adjust the size of the model to be optimal during
									training, and ultimately produce the most compact but effective model for the user to have
								</p>
								<p>
									Although this framework was highly effective for finding optimal solution for fully connected
									networks, fully connected networks are a small subset of possible network architectures. The RL
									Controller lacks the complexity needed to determine when to adjust the number of layers because the
									ability to adjust the number of layers increases the degrees of freedom for the controller dramatically.
									Since the RL Controller is rewarded based on the change in (1), the model prone to getting stuck in
									local minimum. This is exacerbated by a lack of training data for the RL Controller with the ground
									truth, which would allow the RL Controller to be trained based on reaching the optimal network size
									rather than simply moving toward the local optimal solution.
								</p>

								<h3>5.1 &ensp;Future Work
								</h2>
								<p>
									This method of network architecture search was limited to fully connected networks which limits
									the class of problems this algorithm can solve and simplifies the problem significantly for the RL
									Controller. Expanding DNAS to be able to learn CNN, RNN, and other more advanced architectures
									will vastly expand its use cases, and could have profound effects for data scientists everywhere.
									Additionally, improving the DNAS algorithm to allow for stable learning of the processes to add and
									remove hidden layers. As previously mentioned, adding layer adjustments to the RL Controller will
									significantly increase it’s complexity and thus the amount of data need to train it will increase, so
									pre-training the RL Controller on well know data sets may be advantageous. For example, training the
									RL Controller using well established models as the ground truth may help it learn layer organization
									strategies from these hand made models. Finding solutions to these issues in our project and exploring
									improved methods will surely yield to better, more comprehensive future results.
